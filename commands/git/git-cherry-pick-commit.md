### Cherry Pick a Commit 

Copy a commit from one branch to another. Run the below command on the destination branch where you want your commit to be copied

`git cherry pick -x {{COMMIT_SHA}}`

- <b>COMMIT_SHA: </b> Commit ID of the commit, which needs to be copied

#### Example:

`git commit -x ef579afe0a4540dfced0576930cbf88568cb8a12`

This will copy the commit from source branch and add it in current branch
